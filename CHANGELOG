 - CPU: Pre-decrement mode dropped, a post-increment on write only introduced
   instead.
 - Peripheral RAM interface: Post-increment on write only introduced.
 - CPU: DIV and MUL / MAC instruction's timing is made more relaxed.

 - New kernel calls and state variable for simple stereoscopic 3D support.
 - Clarification in state saves regarding bits which must be set zero in the
   Application State.
 - License changed to the Temporary RRPGE License.


Version 00.011.003 (2014.10.24)
 - Bugfix in the GDG: Display list def. & process flags latch at 0x055 in the
   state must be initialized with the same value as the register in the UPA.

 - CPU: In post-incrementing or pre-decrementing modes the full XH part is
   affected irrespective of the pointer mode.
 - Formatting issue of a table in inputdev.rst fixed.

   the 187.5Hz clock).
 - Latched Display List Definition added to the Application State (necessary
   to support the Display List clear function in the GDG.


Version 00.011.000 (2014.09.20)
 - Introduction of data space stack, primarily to support adapting a C
   compiler in the future.
 - Application descriptor (in the Application binary) changes to accommodate
   stack configuration.

   relative pointers.
 - Reversed the position of Data and separate Stack areas in state saves to
   ease merging them in one address space in emulators.
 - Get UTF-8 representation of User ID kernel call's size parameters are
   changed to word units.


Version 00.010.001 (2014.09.19)
 - Application state fields added to hold important elements of the
   Application descriptor (from the application binary).
 - Acceleartor's remaining cycle count must not contain Mixer cycles.
 - File name area size parameters in File system kernel calls are added to

 - The main README.rst updated to match the new architecture.


Version 00.010.000 (2014.09.16)
 - Large changes!
 - Paging concept removed entirely. This affects file structures, kernel
   calls, RAM layout, and in general just about everything. Nothing remains at
   the user's point of view from the previous 4 KWord paging system. Paging
   implemented for the purposes of the kernel does not affect the user end
   RRPGE functionality, so does not belong to this specification.
 - File formats (RRPGE Application and State save) are redesigned entirely.
 - The ROPD (Read Only Process Descriptor) concept is removed.
 - New peripheral concept, roughly the Video RAM turning into a 2 MWords
   Peripheral RAM accessible on a 32 bit Peripheral bus. The peripherals
   (including the Mixer DMA) operate in parallel with the RRPGE CPU.
 - The CPU's address space is fixed from the user's point of view, giving
   access to about 64 KWords of CPU RAM.
 - DMA functions introduced in 00.006.000 are removed.
 - CPU: The ASL (Low bit extending shift to left) instruction is dropped for a
   NOT and a NEG instruction.
 - CPU: The JFL and JML opcodes changed into relative jumps and calls. The
   mnemonic of the original JMR changes into JMS.
 - Graphics Display Generator received a Display list clear feature which it
   can exploit in the VBlank after a Display list definition change.
 - Minor graphics double buffering assistance features introduced.
 - Arbitrary source start in the Accelerator's Block Blitter removed.
 - Frequency source option and frequency tables from the Mixer removed.
 - Touch sensitive areas and touch awareness feature removed, changed over for
   a pointing device specific area query.
 - Kernel functions from now return in C:X3, to adapt to a preferred calling
   convention.
 - RRPGE logo trademark state changed (registered European trademark).


Version 00.009.002 (2014.08.04)
 - Color output (Graphics Display Generator) specification made more accurate
   by mandating a gamma of 2.2.
 - Boot state modified: Pointer modes are now initialized to 16 bit
   incrementing.


Version 00.009.001 (2014.07.27)
 - Accelerator's Pixel OR mask was moved down into the destination combine
   stage (to have it's effect after determining the colorkey).


Version 00.009.000 (2014.07.25)
 - Graphics FIFO command word got a skip feature.
 - Accelerator's register layout changed to fit better to a source definition
   versus blit style principle.
 - Graphics Display Generator's source definition format rewritten:
   simplified, and more flexible.


Version 00.008.001 (2014.07.19)
 - Updated the main README of the project (contained references to obsolete
   and removed features).


Version 00.008.000 (2014.07.03)
 - Reorganizing and cleaning up the changes introduced in 00.006.000 and
   00.007.000.
 - The Graphics FIFO no longer has a beam wait condition.
 - The Accelerator got a row counter so it is capable to blit rectangular
   areas in one go.
 - The Accelerator registers no longer change after a blit (the row counter
   obsoleted this feature), this rolls back the FIFO change of 00.007.003 as
   well.
 - Graphics Display Generator registers were removed from the Graphics FIFO,
   moved into the User Peripheral Area.


Version 00.007.003 (2014.07.01)
 - Graphics FIFO: Command word latch does not increment on store if it
   addresses the Accelerator's start trigger.


Version 00.007.002 (2014.07.01)
 - Fix in the accelerator's memory map (0x002 is not unused).


Version 00.007.001 (2014.06.29)
 - Undefined behavior noted for the Graphics Display Generator registers.
 - Probable Video RAM bank crossing in the Graphics Display Generator
   clarified.
 - Fix in the initialization data: the page of the ROPD was incorrect.


Version 00.007.000 (2014.06.28)
 - New Graphics Display Generator supporting more flexible means for
   generating the pixel data for the video signal.


Version 00.006.003 (2014.06.27)

 - Graphics FIFO introduced, the Graphics registers are no longer accessible
   directly by the CPU.

   of 4, simplifying Video bus access schemes.

 - All peripheral register areas are reorganized.
 - Memory on the CPU bus is increased from 1 MWords to 2 MWords.
 - The Accelerator got a line drawing mode (original "Line" mode renamed to

 - The Accelerator is capable to omit destination reads accelerating certain
   types of blits.
 - Separation of partition selects from address both in the Mixer and the
   Accelerator simplifying address calculations.

   yellow) instead of BC4 (bright green).


Version 00.001.000 (2014.04.04)
 - Sprite clipping support introduced: the Block Blitter of the Graphics
   Accelerator is now able to start blitting from any source position which is
   necessary for this capability. The register layout of the accelerator was
