Version 00.007.001 (2014.06.29)
 - Undefined behavior noted for the Graphics Display Generator registers.
 - Probable Video RAM bank crossing in the Graphics Display Generator
   clarified.
 - Fix in the initialization data: the page of the ROPD was incorrect.


Version 00.007.000 (2014.06.28)
 - New Graphics Display Generator supporting more flexible means for
   generating the pixel data for the video signal.


Version 00.006.003 (2014.06.27)
 - Video kernel calls are allowed to termiate the application on Graphics FIFO
   non-empty condition.


Version 00.006.002 (2014.06.26)
 - Added some flexibility in handling an unfulfillable Graphics FIFO beam wait
   command (in ropddump.rst).
 - Clarifications in the emulation of Graphics FIFO processing cycles.
 - Graphics FIFO state storage fixes (in ropddump.rst).


Version 00.006.001 (2014.06.25)
 - Fixed initial ROPD state in boot.rst, according to starting in 8 bit mode.
 - Fixed snd_arch.rst so the sample counter points to samples, not words.


Version 00.006.000 (2014.06.20)
 - Large changes!
 - Graphics FIFO introduced, the Graphics registers are no longer accessible
   directly by the CPU.
 - Graphics display now is only capable to produce 2 distinct layers instead
   of 4, simplifying Video bus access schemes.
 - Relative addressing in display lists are removed.
 - All peripheral register areas are reorganized.
 - Memory on the CPU bus is increased from 1 MWords to 2 MWords.
 - The Accelerator got a line drawing mode (original "Line" mode renamed to
   "Fill" mode).
 - The Accelerator is capable to omit destination reads accelerating certain
   types of blits.
 - Separation of partition selects from address both in the Mixer and the
   Accelerator simplifying address calculations.
 - User accessible interrupt (event) system is removed.
 - Audio output reworked to be useful without interrupts.
 - DMA peripherals introduced for fast memory fills and copies.
 - The specification got an Overview document describing the overall hardware
   architecture.
 - Many minor changes to keep the system coherent with the listed
   modifications.


Version 00.005.000 (2014.05.11)
 - Introduced proper hotplug support for input devices.
 - Input device kernel call layout rearranged to be more consistent.


Version 00.004.002 (2014.05.10)
 - Fixed some inaccuracies in some kernel calls (kcall.rst), mostly relating
   to file I/O functions.


Version 00.004.001 (2014.05.07)
 - Fixed kc_usr_getutf to accept the user ID as parameter.
 - Fixed parameter descriptions of kc_usr_getcolors.


Version 00.004.000 (2014.05.06)
 - Audio output reworked into a simpler more flexible concept.
 - Video mode change (between 4 bit and 8 bit) added.


Version 00.003.000 (2014.05.04)
 - Update to RRPGE License version 2.
 - Input devices reworked, simplified, now supporting keyboard.
 - File system interface reworked for a more generic approach.


Version 00.002.000 (2014.04.23)
 - Video RAM partitioning changes to support scrolling surfaces better: now
   all four Video RAM banks can be partitioned seperately and have an X wrap
   feature.
 - RRPGE Incremetal palette minor tweak: Color index 11 is now CC4 (bright
   yellow) instead of BC4 (bright green).


Version 00.001.000 (2014.04.04)
 - Sprite clipping support introduced: the Block Blitter of the Graphics
   Accelerator is now able to start blitting from any source position which is
   necessary for this capability. The register layout of the accelerator was
   modified to properly fit in the new Block Blitter source fraction.


Version 00.000.001 (2014.04.02)
 - Typo and reStructuredText markup fixes.


Version 00.000.000 (2014.03.30)
 - Initial version, core specification roughly complete.
