Version 00.018.000 (2015.10.01)
 - Simplified Graphics Display Generator removing 8 bit mode and some unused
   or less useful features in the remaining 4 bit mode.
 - Graphics Display Generator 4 bit mode was expanded to support a total of 64
   colors with palette selectors.
 - Graphics Display Generator got an X expansion feature making it possible to
   use wide pixel sprites or modes (such as 320x200 with double scanning).
 - Support for 8 bit mode was removed from the Accelerator.
 - Some changes in the User Library reflecting the removal of the 8 bit mode.
 - New, simpler event based input concept, completely redesigning the input
   interface.
 - 16 bit audio output accompanied with a redesigned Mixer.


Version 00.017.000 (2015.07.12)
 - New PSH (Push) and POP instructions for loading and storing multiple
   registers from / to the stack, decreasing function prolog and epilog sizes
   and execution times.
 - Function calls (JFR, JFA and JSV) no longer traverse the parameter list
   again after return.
 - CPU timing updates including adding coarse implementation details in
   "impl_hw", causing roughly a 5% - 10% raise in usual throughput. Function
   entry and exit codes became notably faster (which are also simpler to
   emulate by interpreting emulators).


Version 00.016.000 (2015.03.11)
 - User Library size increased from 4 KWords to 8 KWords, moving the entry
   point table down to start at 0xE000.
 - New object-oriented concepts in the User Library, notably at the
   realization of interfaces (tileset interface redesign), also changing the
   names of some functions ("new" functions introduced).
 - Calling convention modified: C and X3 are zeroed unless a return value is
   produced in either.
 - Two new pointer setup functions for 16 bit PRAM pointers, also changing the
   naming conventions. Pointer setup functions no longer produce return in C.
 - Font management refined, adding a larger, UTF capable font.
 - Printf and related character reader and writer infrastructure added.
 - CPU RAM data rearranged so User Library provided objects generate 1 word
   literals in function calls.
 - Accelerator destination partition size moved from 0x8014 to 0x8002, into
   the destination bank select, to completely separate source and destination
   configurations. Registers are renamed accordingly.
 - Mixer partitioning and bank selection registers are reorganized to seperate
   source and destination configurations (similarly to the Accelerator).
 - FIFO skip feature changed: now bit 15 set written to address skips.
 - Reordered instruction set along with removing the "ADD sp, adr" and the
   "SUB sp, adr" instructions. Otherwise source compatibility is retained.
 - Added special immediate encodings for register loads (MOV), function
   parameters and SP loads, reducing binary size.
 - JMR and JMA now can load PC into a register, providing support for "light"
   subroutines.
 - RFN now can load X3 and optionally zero C to produce return value.
 - New JNZ instruction jumping if its register operand is nonzero.
 - New skips for the Stack Pointer providing better support for variable
   number of arguments.
 - Sub-word memory addressing scheme changed to provide fractional bits (the
   XH register renamed to XB, referring to pointer fractional bits).
 - JSV changed to accept a service operand, kernel calls are re-allocated
   accordingly (the syntax of JSV is now similar to normal function calls).


Version 00.015.003 (2015.01.23)
 - Fast scrolling tile mapper added to the User Library.

 - The main README.rst updated to match the new architecture.


Version 00.010.000 (2014.09.16)
 - Large changes!
 - Paging concept removed entirely. This affects file structures, kernel
   calls, RAM layout, and in general just about everything. Nothing remains at
   the user's point of view from the previous 4 KWord paging system. Paging
   implemented for the purposes of the kernel does not affect the user end
   RRPGE functionality, so does not belong to this specification.
 - File formats (RRPGE Application and State save) are redesigned entirely.
 - The ROPD (Read Only Process Descriptor) concept is removed.

   Peripheral RAM accessible on a 32 bit Peripheral bus. The peripherals
   (including the Mixer DMA) operate in parallel with the RRPGE CPU.
 - The CPU's address space is fixed from the user's point of view, giving
   access to about 64 KWords of CPU RAM.
 - DMA functions introduced in 00.006.000 are removed.

   mnemonic of the original JMR changes into JMS.
 - Graphics Display Generator received a Display list clear feature which it
   can exploit in the VBlank after a Display list definition change.
 - Minor graphics double buffering assistance features introduced.
 - Arbitrary source start in the Accelerator's Block Blitter removed.
 - Frequency source option and frequency tables from the Mixer removed.
 - Touch sensitive areas and touch awareness feature removed, changed over for
   a pointing device specific area query.
 - Kernel functions from now return in C:X3, to adapt to a preferred calling
   convention.
 - RRPGE logo trademark state changed (registered European trademark).


Version 00.009.002 (2014.08.04)
 - Color output (Graphics Display Generator) specification made more accurate
   by mandating a gamma of 2.2.

   incrementing.


Version 00.009.001 (2014.07.27)
 - Accelerator's Pixel OR mask was moved down into the destination combine
   stage (to have it's effect after determining the colorkey).

   00.007.000.
 - The Graphics FIFO no longer has a beam wait condition.
 - The Accelerator got a row counter so it is capable to blit rectangular
   areas in one go.
 - The Accelerator registers no longer change after a blit (the row counter
   obsoleted this feature), this rolls back the FIFO change of 00.007.003 as
   well.
 - Graphics Display Generator registers were removed from the Graphics FIFO,
   moved into the User Peripheral Area.


Version 00.007.003 (2014.07.01)
 - Graphics FIFO: Command word latch does not increment on store if it
   addresses the Accelerator's start trigger.


Version 00.007.002 (2014.07.01)
 - Fix in the accelerator's memory map (0x002 is not unused).


Version 00.007.001 (2014.06.29)
 - Undefined behavior noted for the Graphics Display Generator registers.

   clarified.

   yellow) instead of BC4 (bright green).


Version 00.001.000 (2014.04.04)
 - Sprite clipping support introduced: the Block Blitter of the Graphics
   Accelerator is now able to start blitting from any source position which is
   necessary for this capability. The register layout of the accelerator was
   modified to properly fit in the new Block Blitter source fraction.
